# EarlySM
Early S(oftware)M(manager)
I call this early because this is my first try to create new types of commands. My intention is to pretty much create some sort of commands that are "easy" and "useful" so that you can understand the syntax more easily. I have no idea about assembly or how to make an operating system. My intention is to make this into an operating system, but the problem is as I said I had no idea how to make this into one, so I hope whoever is reading this would like to make some sort of bootable version of this.

This program is meant to simulate (or emulate) how I would like the OS to look like. This is meant to be compiled on windows.

If the windows.h header file and its functions are a problem if you don't want to use windows, feel free to remove them and to replace them with whatever you want that does the same thing. (for example UNIX has unistd.h that also has some sleep functions)

Thank you.
