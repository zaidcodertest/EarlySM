Thank you - side note: You'd most likely care about the updates folder the most, thats where you'd find the source code you want to compile.
# EarlySM
Early S(oftware)M(manager)
I call this early because this is my first try to create new types of commands. My intention is to pretty much create some sort of commands that are "easy" and "useful" so that you can understand the syntax more easily. I have no idea about assembly or how to make an operating system. My intention is to make this into an operating system, but the problem is as I said I had no idea how to make this into one, so I hope whoever is reading this would like to make some sort of bootable version of this.

This program is meant to simulate (or emulate) how I would like the OS to look like. This is meant to be compiled on windows.

If the windows.h header file and its functions are a problem if you don't want to use windows, feel free to remove them and to replace them with whatever you want that does the same thing. (for example UNIX has unistd.h that also has some sleep functions)

Thank you.

# Where to get latest version
In the "updates" folder you will see all the versions after the first version.
# How to compile and run
With current versions from EarlySM to EarlySM 16, the entire programs are only just one file that uses the standard c++ library. The only external header file I really have is the windows.h which I beleive could be swapped by the unistd.h header file and its functions that is on UNIX if you are trying to compile it from there.

To sumarize just copy and paste the code of whatever version you want and compile from there.
# "updates" folder
This is the folder where the updated versions of EarlySM are kept, along with an update tracker which lists what each update has that is new from previous versions. Another file called "update_nomenclature.md" lists the update naming system.
# "manual" folder
This folder is supposed to contain the manual for EarlySM.
# "general-text" folder SECT---
Everything below belongs in the "general-text" folder.
# "The_roots_of_EarlySM" folder
This is a weird looking paragraph that gives the general ideas behind the decision of creating this project.
PART-OF "general-text"
# "10th edition acknowledgment EarlySM" folder
This folder contains a sort of celebration over EarlySM's tenth version.

# "function ideas" folder
This folder could also be for other ideas for programming languages, including functions for programming languages as the folder name states.
PART-OF "general-text".
# "plans" folder
This is pretty much where I want to add a feature but don't because I don't get the idea how to implement something, or in my experience trying was buggy. I leave these things out for people to see so that maybe they might have an idea what to do with them.

# "writing" folder
These are just ideas and goals for this project in general.
