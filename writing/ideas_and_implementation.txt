My idea in my head was when you make an operating system, this is something to I would put in my mind "make the looks, features, commands, processes, and etc as EASY and USEFUL as possible".
As for example, what would be a useful command? What is the most useful thing I could get out of a computer anyways? Maybe downloading applications is a useful and important task. So I want to make a command based off of downloading applications online.
Now, I need to make it easy to use, so that a beginner doesn't get to intimidated, stressed, or anything like that than go to another operating system that might be easier.
So here are some steps I take:

1. Design
2. Find a way to implement
3. Actually program it
4. Debug
5. Repeat

So let me design this to be easy (below is what running the commands to do such task looks like):

-> SM_downloader
-> What would you like to download today? Calculator
-> Searching for "Calculator" in our servers...
-> Here are some results:
-> Calculator_by_bob
-> Calculator_by_dad
-> Calculator_by_company
-> Enter one of the names of the programs above to download them: Calculator_by_bob
-> Downloading...
-> Successfully downloaded Calculator_by_bob and its files to /bin

As you can see, what I'm trying to aim for here is a fun and easy, but powerful experience to make using CLI somewhat less stressful if that makes any sense. Thank you for reading.

(also, it doesn't have to be new commands that follow the standard only, you can take existing UNIX commands and try to spice it up a bit too!)
