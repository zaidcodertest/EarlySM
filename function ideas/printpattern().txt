printpattern() is supposed to be a shortcut to while and for loops offering more features and additions to it. printpattern() nests the printshape() function inside of it.
it takes 3 parameters. The first one is the amount of repitition, the second one is a boolean where 1 means you want a log of your print function and 0 means you don't want one, and the third is what you want to print out.
