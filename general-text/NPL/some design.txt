---VARIABLE DECLARATIONS
number(16, NO_DECIMAL) variable_number;  //variable that is 16 bit, and has no decimal (MUST SEPCIFY). Basically its not float or long, a bit like an int.
chars(16) variable_characters; //variable that is 16 bit, it is basically like a string, and not like the C style of char.
bin(8) variable_binary; //8 bit binary variable. it stores a binary value such as 00000001.

---OUTPUT
TERMINAL_OUT("Hello");

---INPUT
TERMINAL_IN(variable_number, MULTI_INPUT); //input for the variable "variable_number". The second parameter states that it is multi worded/multi space. It will take input until the user hits the enter key.

---BINARY CONVERSIONS //(sidenote, this does not convert the variable from type "bin" to however other variable. It is simply to print out the binary value coverted.)
bin(8) variable_binary; //declare variable
variable_binary.number(16, NO_DECIMAL); //(try to) convert to a 16 bit number.
variable_binary.chars(32); //(try to) convert to a 32 bit character (or even characters, like in a sentence)

---TEMPORARY VARIABLES
temp(0) number(16, NO_DECIMAL) variable_number; //temp means that this is "deletable", (0) is to assign a value to point to the variable to delete. So that means you are not saying destroy(variable_number), but else wise.
destroy(0); //remove, destroy, delete are all apropriate words to describe whats happening to the variable.

---IF STATEMENTS
//pretty much the same as C / C++
