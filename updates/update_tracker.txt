Early SM: first version.

Early SM 1: Added a manual page feature. Basically, if you put a "?" before a command like this: "?help", it will pull up information on the "help" command. It is pretty much like the "man" in UNIX.

Early SM 2: Not done yet. Planning to add a function type command that looks like a function in programming. Hoping that this introduces a new styling for commands on a command line that makes it more flexible.
