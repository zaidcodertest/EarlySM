Early SM: !FINISHED! First version. comes with random commands. Mostly calculators.

Early SM 1: !FINISHED! Added a manual page feature. Basically, if you put a "?" before a command like this: "?help", it will pull up information on the "help" command. It is pretty much like the "man" command in UNIX.

Early SM 2: !FINISHED! Added a function type command that looks like a function in programming. Hoping that this introduces a new styling for commands on a command line that makes it more flexible.
To be more specific: I wanted to make a command that changes the color of the terminal, being "layout(background color,text color)" as the command.

Early SM 3: !FINISHED! Added some logic gate / bitwise operating commands to calculate logic through the program. Them being AND, and NAND. 
Also updated some of the help pages for the calculator commands to make it more understandable. Didn't know how to implement the remaining XAND OR NOR NAND XOR I said I would.

Early SM 4: !FINISHED! Added another function type command called output(). It is supposed to help output information.

Early SM 5: !FINISHED! Added a program that creates a table for you.

Early SM 6: !FINISHED! Added more to the hardware command. Added information on the local computer name, and added information on random access memory (RAM).

Early SM 7: !FINISHED! Added a c++ programming tutorial guide. On top of that we added the manual as it says in the OS "Please check your manual for usage"
in the manual folder. The manual was added digitaly to EarlySM. Also a small change was made to output(time).
