Early SM: first version.

Early SM 1: Added a manual page feature. Basically, if you put a "?" before a command like this: "?help", it will pull up information on the "help" command. It is pretty much like the "man" in UNIX.

Early SM 2: Not done yet. Planning to add a function type command that looks like a function in programming. Hoping that this introduces a new styling for commands on a command line that makes it more flexible.
To be more specific: I wanted to make a command that changes the color of the terminal, being "layout(text color, background color)" as the command. The current stage is that I'm trying to look for proper functions to implement this.
New thing: I'm also adding some logic gate / bitwise operating commands to calculate logic through the program.
