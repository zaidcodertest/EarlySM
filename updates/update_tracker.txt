Early SM: !FINISHED! First version. comes with random commands. Mostly calculators.

Early SM 1: !FINISHED! Added a manual page feature. Basically, if you put a "?" before a command like this: "?help", it will pull up information on the "help" command. It is pretty much like the "man" command in UNIX.

Early SM 2: !FINISHED! Added a function type command that looks like a function in programming. Hoping that this introduces a new styling for commands on a command line that makes it more flexible.
To be more specific: I wanted to make a command that changes the color of the terminal, being "layout(background color,text color)" as the command.

Early SM 3: !FINISHED! Added some logic gate / bitwise operating commands to calculate logic through the program. Them being AND, and NAND. 
Also updated some of the help pages for the calculator commands to make it more understandable. Didn't know how to implement the remaining XAND OR NOR NAND XOR I said I would.

Early SM 4: !FINISHED! Added another function type command called output(). It is supposed to help output information.

Early SM 5: !FINISHED! Added a program that creates a table for you.

Early SM 6: !FINISHED! Added more to the hardware command. Added information on the local computer name, and added information on random access memory (RAM).

Early SM 7: !FINISHED! Added a C++ programming tutorial guide. On top of that we added the manual as it says in the OS "Please check your manual for usage"
from the manual folder. The manual was added digitaly to EarlySM. Also a small change was made to output(time).

Early SM 8: !FINISHED! Added more to the C++ programming tutorial. On top of that there is a number conversion program that converts between units.
Also fixed the hardware command from some error.

Early SM 9: !FINISHED! Created an OS usage guide that works a bit like the C++ guide. Failure for std::getline to work properly, which means create_file stays the same.
Also added output(dir_info) which will say the directory you are in and its contents.

Early SM 10: !FINISHED! This time around I'm planning on creating a "building generator" game where you can specify how wide and tall you want your building to be.
By pure coincidence, I found out how to get create_file some what working by throwing std::cin in a while loop and continiously appending to another variable.
Because of this I'll remove create_file from the plans folder as it looks like I got it behaving normal.

Early SM 11: !FINISHED! Added a RGB tool to deal wih RGB. It is basically supposed to see how your color combos would look like.

Early SM 12: !FINISHED! Added some sort of temporary clipboard where you could temporarily store text that you can look back into. You can store, remove, and print text from the clipboard.
