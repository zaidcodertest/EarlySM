The update nomenclature (naming system) works like this:

Everytime you "update" the software manager (SM), as in giving it an additional list of features, bug fixes, etc, you name the SM something new.
For example, I added some sort of a manual feature (you may recognize it as "man" in UNIX) where yout put a question mark before a command to know more about it.
I'm going to finalize this update as this for now, So I'm going to add a "1" at the end like this: EarlySM 1.

And than the next update happens to the SM, the next version will be called "EarlySM 2" and so on so forth.

For more understanding, I'll keep a text file in this directory keeping up with versions and their updates.
