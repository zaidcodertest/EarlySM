EarlySM is an operating system based off of the menality of simplifying to make things easier.
In other words provinding the best experience combining usability and ease.

In this manual we will be talking about how we suppose to use an operating system with such mentality embeded in its foundation.

At first you are shown up with a login screen. Just put "zaid" to get in.

Afterwards, you are in the normal territory to be expected in of your average shell

In order to find all of your commands, enter "help".

Once you do, you'll be shown all the commands you have.

As you could see, "help" is also a part of other commands meaning it is built within the same family.

Put a question mark before any command, and you will get a more detailed explanation on what it does. For example "?help".

EarlySM introduces something called "function type commmands" resembling how a function would be used in pogramming.

This makes the commands ever so much more flexible allowing for more control and specification to how you want a function to behave.

Thank you.
