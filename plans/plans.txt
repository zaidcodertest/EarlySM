typedef feature: basically to add a table which works a bit like a pointer. It pretty much works in a way if you want to call a command, but you don't like its name, so you use typedef to add a command which pretty much just points to execute another command that you referenced it to.
It works a bit like this:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ls                 |  executes process that lists directories        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
my_ls              |  pointer to execute ls                          |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
it works like typedef in C and C++, so you can imgagine it like this (except its in a terminal, not a programming language):

typedef int my_int,
typedef ls  my_ls.




Keyboard key tester: this was supposed to be added to EarlySM 5, but trying to get it working resulted in something very buggy. I didn't want to put a feature that didn't work, but you can see the main part of the source code if you want:
void keytest()
{
    if (openingscreen == "test") //if test is typed
    {
        while (GetKeyState(0x46) != 1) //while keystate != 1
        {
            Sleep(200); //added a sleep command to give user time to give some input
        }
        
        LAYOUT_EXCUSE = 1; //if you are wondering what this is, I put this here so I don't mess up the order of the function "openingscreenfunction()". This pretty much tells the error system that "if a command was executed was here please don't throw an error"
    }
}

its supposed to look like this:

Enter your character's ASCII code, or type 500 for a table: 500
*table*
Enter your character's ASCII code, or type 500 for a table: 49
Program will exit either in 60 seconds, or when you press "1":
